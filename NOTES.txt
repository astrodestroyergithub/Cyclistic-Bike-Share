[1] Bicycle industry as a post-pandemic green recovery driver in an emerging economy: a SWOT analysis:
Summary: This paper deals with analyzing and examining the various factors, which portray the bicycle-industry as a potent industry which can lead to the green recovery and sustainable development of economy and environment in Bangladesh. The authors performed a SWOT analysis after collecting and analyzing information with regards to the bicycle industry in the south-asian developing economy from many research publications, and by interviewing industry experts, goverment officials and university professors and finally a joint discussion by all the experts. Based on the findings in which both internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) as well as external factors (opportunities and threats) were taken into consideration, they came up with an internal factor evaluation matrix (IFEM) to find out that the bicycling industry in Bangladesh has enormous potential, given that some reforms be conducted upon the same with a view towards reducing carbon-emissions and decarbonizing the commute sector by facilitating green investment in bicycling as a non-motorized transport (NMT) option to reduce GHG emissions in the post-pandemic settings. Suggested potential strategies to facilitate the adoption of bicycles as a resilient and sustainable transport option such as by developing local manufacturing capability, dedicated infrastructure, reducing import duties, attracting FDIs, eliminating gender differences, etc., were also mentioned.
