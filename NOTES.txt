[3] An analysis of a bike-sharing system from a business model perspective:
Summary: A vision of developing a sustainable bike-sharing system as viewed a PSS (product-service system) was expressed by the authors in this research paper. Although, it was initially developed considering a single focal-company, restricted to a particular region (southern region of developing country, Brazil) only, the authors emphasized the significance of their research-work claimimg that it was the first one to be done keeping in mind the scenario of a developing country. The design of the system-model organized in 4 stages: (i) value proposition, (ii) value configuration, (iii) value delivery and (iv) value capture was introduced. Although, the strategy doesn't hold the providers of the service as the manufacturers themselves, the business-model analyzed was a use-oriented in the context of shared mobility. By conducting face-to-face interviews with those involved in developing the business model, a research protocol was developed. The authors expressed that the PSS business model analyzed by them could represent significant contributions to improve micro-mobility.

[4] Bike share usage and the build environment: A review:
Summary: This paper entirely deals with understanding, analyzing and illustrating the multiple modes and forms of relationships between build environment (i.e., land-use, transportation system and urban design) and bike-share usage. Quite a many variances between the build environment and bike-usage were stated and described with some outliers in notable cases. Variance in relationship in the build environment across different mobility patterns, docked and dockless bike-share patterns, w.r.t. trip purpose, between arrival and departure patterns, based upon the day of week, etc. and the bike-share usage were elaborated. The paper concluded with a brief summary of the major findings of the authors and them encouraging the recommendations for the future research works.

[5] Examining factors associated with bike-and-ride (BnR) activities around metro stations in large-scale dockless bike-sharing systems:
Summary: The study attempted to examine the associations of BnR (bike and ride) activities with metro area w.r.t. DBS (dockless bike sharing) systems, in the city of Shanghai, China. The study signalled that BnR behaviors were affected by features like station features, land use, socio-demographics, roadway designs, transportation facilities, etc. Mainly four metrics were employed in the entire study to understand BnR behaviors from the perspective of different participators viz. local govt., DBS users, etc. The metrics were BnR trip count, shared-bike utilization rate, metro catchment area and BnR rate, for the assessment of BnR performance. The generalized additive model (GAM) was utilized to build statistical inference. Several statistical issues such as over-dispersion, skewness and spatial autocorrelation were addressed while modelling DBS usage. The spatial distribution of the 4 metrics suggested that shared bikes were oversupplied in the city center while undersupplied in the suburb. Based on other things, various other conclusions were drawn for comprehensive analysis.

[12] Unlimited-ride bike-share pass pricing revenue management for casual riders using only public data:
Summary: The authors scrutinized revenue management strategies for unlimited usage bike-share scenarios in their research paper. Citi Bike public data has been used by the authors for the overall analysis. Summarization of the basic data for understanding the behavioral patterns of the casual users and the number of trips that casual users take was estimated for relating between the two, because such data was not publicly available. The parameters of these distributions were derived from sample means and standard deviations using linear regression of daily short-term ticket sales and occasional passenger numbers. A path choice model was built using variables resampled from the fitted distribution by the bootstrap method. The multinomial logit model was used because it could represent not only individual vote probabilities but also aggregated market shares. As a result, the price combination of the two plans was optimized to maximize revenue based on estimated model output, and the impact on consumer surplus was quantified.

[13] An approach to modeling bike-sharing systems based on spatial equity concept:
Summary: This paper deals with providing a set of illustrative examples and performing a series of sensitivity analysis tests to propose an original model to find out the number and layout of the bike stations as well as the number of bicycles and free-racks for modeling bike-sharing systems based upon spatial equity concept aimimg towards reducing implementation and operational cost of the existing such systems. In the research paper proposed by the authors, a linear programming model was developed and tested to determine the number and layout of stations and the number of bikes and racks available at each station to set up and operate the BSS for each level of defined service, terms and conditions cost was minimized. The proposed linear mathematics problem minimized the setup and execution costs of a new BSS using a set of constraints that reflect the idea of ​​a balanced and fair level of service provided to all users of the system.

[14] Optimizing bike sharing systems: dynamic prediction using machine learning and statistical techniques and rebalancing:
Summary: Cities all around the world are increasingly getting concerned about the detrimental effects of increasing number of vehicles on their roads, viz., greater pollution, emission rates, congestion, etc., which has led many of then to take active steps in order to prevent such things. One of the most effective and efficient alternative and life-saver which has come out from the horizon in this regards is the usage of BSSs or bike-sharing systems. Many cities have also been seen to adopt BSSs to tackle such growing problems and more. This increased use of bicycles has prompted many cities to either expand existing systems or introduce new ones. Due to the unbalanced spatio-temporal demands of cycle tours, many cycle stations are either empty or full during the day. This could have a significant impact on the reliability and usefulness of BSS and encourage drivers to return to using their vehicles or choose alternative modes of transport, resulting in increased congestion and emissions and pollution may increase. This reduces the number of BSS users and reduces system revenue. Operators recognized the imbalance and began building more bike stations closer to each other with the aim of keeping them within a five-minute walk. However, this solution is both financially and practically difficult to implement. This extensive and enormous report and aggregation of research paper methodologies proposes a new generation of BSSs, in which some can be portable, i.e, it takes into account both the types of BSSs (docked and dockless bike-sharing systems). Specifically, the framework consists of two levels: We use fast, online, and incremental learning approaches to predict the number of bikes at stations and balance the system with wearable stations. The goal is a framework that solves the dynamic bike-sharing relocation problem to minimize unmet demand and increase or decrease user satisfaction. The dissertation by the authors contributes to the field in 5 ways. First, a multi-objective supervised clustering algorithm was developed to identify similarities in bicycle use with respect to time events. Second, a dynamic, interpretable and fast approach was developed for predicting the number of bikes at stations within a BSS. Third, a univariate inventory model was created using a Markov chain process that provides an optimal selection of bike levels at stations. The fourth was to explore the benefits of portable bike stations using an agent-based simulation approach as a proof of concept. Fifth, mathematical and heuristic approaches are proposed.

It also aimed at assessing their longings and preferences towards ICT related attributes.The information for examination of the results was collected in three parts. It comprised of a mobility survey and a stated-choice (SC) experiment. The first part was aimed at collecting the responses from the students of their travel preferences about what mode they use, thoughts regarding inclusion of ICT, perceptions barrier for not cycling and previous cycling experiences. This part was named as the "Simplifying Cycling Mobility". The second part dealt with the household budget and business perpectives and in this both the students and their parents were questioned in order to get insights on what equipments to be installed, ICT preferences, household budget constraits, etc. This part was named as the "Assessing students and their parents' preferences". In the third part a SC experiment was performed to understand the trade-offs information between car travel and e-bike relevant attributes by gathering 2232 observations in that regard. A comprehensive econometric analysis was conducted to assess the nature and degree of heterogeneity in student preferences, also considering gender issues. The authors of this research paper had also taken the final shot at studying the main determinants of both the traditional as well as electric bikes impact on school-to-home/home-to-school trips, using a detailed study of the design using exploratory data analysis and multivariable logistic regression model. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 21 software and R.

[16] Bike sharing: a review of evidence of impacts and processes of implementation and operation:
Summary: The authors of this research-paper worked on a very special and distinct idea and approach of reviewing the existing schemes and research-suggestions and findings of previous researches on bike-sharing: how well the schemes of implementation and operation suggested by the past research-approaches have actually come out victorious or to what extent such were actually guiding the working of the present bike-sharing schemes present in different parts of the world actually implementing such schemes. They provided a comprehensive review of such evidences. By following a two-fold measure: understanding and examining evidence-gaps and limitations that need further investigation; and by drawing on the evidence review and justifying whether the positive-sides of the approaches mentioned actually aid in transferability, beneficial impacts and operation-processes or not, they sought to put light on both the impacts as well as the processes (rather than just processes) as a target to enhance the current body of knowledge on bike-sharing and also contributing towards the ongoing academic and policy discourse on the increasing popular cycling measure. A sectional segmented approach was taken by the authors, as they sought to provide a critical overview of the increasing number of information sources and the growing body of knowledge about bike-sharing; discussing the evidence on users, usage and impacts of bike sharing's significance and limitations after summarizing them; providing an evidence on managing the business of bike-sharing from a process evaluation perspective; they concluded the paper by discussing how the evidence presented here can help strengthen and transfer positive results to other contexts in terms of impact and implementation processes, and identify key areas for further investigation.

[18] Bicycle sharing systems demand:
Summary: The study methodology proposed by the authors in this research paper aims to study the demands of the bicycle sharing systems, at the level of defining zones, with higher potential demand in urban areas. The literature survey conducted by the authors of this research paper presented some broad ideas, which included types of bicycle-sharing systems right from the antique to the modern systems, viz., free bike system, coin-deposit systems, information technology-based systems and multimodal systems; demand studies for cycling and bike-sharing: latent demand score method, 'revealed' or 'stated' preference surveys; etc. The methodology suggested by the authors to study the demand distributions for bike-sharing involves the two parts: quantifying the demand based upon other case studies; and defining the effect on demand caused by trip characteristics. The second part encompassed analyzing the factors such as purpose, distance, slopes, etc. and their effects on the the bicycle sharing demands thus making a cohesiveness study among the various factors proposed. After studying all these, the authors put the proposed methodology and their knowledge to exercise on the case study of Coimbra (a town located in the centre of Portugal). The conclusion came with pointing out the advantages being that the methodology proposed provides a quick-assessment technique, it can be adapted to other towns and cities, and that it is useful in the full design of the system. The paper ended with the authors pointing out the areas in which there is a scope for further studies in this area.

[19] Are bikeshare users different from regular cyclists? a first look at short-term users, 3 annual members, and area cyclists in the Washington, DC region:
Summary: In this research paper, the authors investigated the travel behavior characteristics of bicycle system users. A comparative analysis was done to understand the differences between annual members and short-term user profiles on Capital Bikeshare (CaBi). The data used for the overall research was gathered from Washington, DC area regional household travel survey of 2007-2008, an intercept 10 survey of short-term CaBi users, and an online survey of annual CaBi members. This paper deals with a case study of short-term and annual bikeshare users of Capital 13 Bikeshare (CaBi) in Washington, DC and Arlington County, VA. The monthly and annual users were subjected to an online membership survey, while the users who has a 24-hour or 5-day membership were examined on the basis of 23 survey questions. The objectives for the long-term members were to collect info on demographic and use characteristics of CaBi members, 4 satisfaction with the system, and changes in travel patterns based on bikeshare availability. Short-term users who did not have time to complete the verbal 19 survey were provided with instructions for completing the survey online. The analysis part comprised of the discussion on various aspects: Demographics of Area Cyclists, Short-Term Users, and Annual Members; Income, Car Ownership, and Access to a Bicycle; Trip Purpose, Mode Shift, and Helmet Use. Finally before concluding the paper, the authors also touched upon some of the scopes for future research which included whether there could be significant differences or not between Area and CaBi users when controlling for other factors, admitting that the analysis cannot fully consider the spatial restrictions of the two CaBi surveys, presence of potential biases over the sample as CaBi annual member survey respondents self-selected from email and online solicitations, and 6 responded over the internet, Results for the Washington, DC area may not apply to other US cities, etc.
