[1] Bicycle industry as a post-pandemic green recovery driver in an emerging economy: a SWOT analysis:
Summary: This paper deals with analyzing and examining the various factors, which portray the bicycle-industry as a potent industry which can lead to the green recovery and sustainable development of economy and environment in Bangladesh. The authors performed a SWOT analysis after collecting and analyzing information with regards to the bicycle industry in the south-asian developing economy from many research publications, and by interviewing industry experts, goverment officials and university professors and finally a joint discussion by all the experts. Based on the findings in which both internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) as well as external factors (opportunities and threats) were taken into consideration, they came up with an internal factor evaluation matrix (IFEM) to find out that the bicycling industry in Bangladesh has enormous potential, given that some reforms be conducted upon the same with a view towards reducing carbon-emissions and decarbonizing the commute sector by facilitating green investment in bicycling as a non-motorized transport (NMT) option to reduce GHG emissions in the post-pandemic settings. Suggested potential strategies to facilitate the adoption of bicycles as a resilient and sustainable transport option such as by developing local manufacturing capability, dedicated infrastructure, reducing import duties, attracting FDIs, eliminating gender differences, etc., were also mentioned.

[2] Bike-sharing usage prediction with deep learning: a survey:
Summary: The analysis of the pattern of bike-sharing in a region plays the most significant role in predicting the bike usage in any particular region. The authors in this paper, have provided a comprehensive review of bike-sharing usage prediction with many invaluable approaches to predict the bike-sharing usage pattern with deep learning. Following a set of procedures of the following modules: data aggregation to build the prediction input-features and targets, defining 3 data formats (time-series format, grid format and graph format), addressing 3 types of prediction problems (time series-input prediction, graph-input prediction and grid-input prediction), quantifying the prediction error using different evaluation metrics, and finally some prediction challenges (complex spatial dependencies and complex temporal dependencies) and prediction models like FFNN, LSTM, RNN, GNN, GRU, MLP, SVR, etc., were illustrated  with a different section for each type of model was mentioned for both docked and dock-less bike-sharing systems. Finally, application scenarios within the bike-sharing systems and beyond were brought up followed by the challenges and the development directions in the research paper. More open datasets, various applications based on bike usage prediction and potential research directions were summarized to encourage future research.

[3] An analysis of a bike-sharing system from a business model perspective:
Summary: A vision of developing a sustainable bike-sharing system as viewed a PSS (product-service system) was expressed by the authors in this research paper. Although, it was initially developed considering a single focal-company, restricted to a particular region (southern region of developing country, Brazil) only, the authors emphasized the significance of their research-work claimimg that it was the first one to be done keeping in mind the scenario of a developing country. The design of the system-model organized in 4 stages: (i) value proposition, (ii) value configuration, (iii) value delivery and (iv) value capture was introduced. Although, the strategy doesn't hold the providers of the service as the manufacturers themselves, the business-model analyzed was a use-oriented in the context of shared mobility. By conducting face-to-face interviews with those involved in developing the business model, a research protocol was developed. The authors expressed that the PSS business model analyzed by them could represent significant contributions to improve micro-mobility.

[4] Bike share usage and the build environment: A review:
Summary: This paper entirely deals with understanding, analyzing and illustrating the multiple modes and forms of relationships between build environment (i.e., land-use, transportation system and urban design) and bike-share usage. Quite a many variances between the build environment and bike-usage were stated and described with some outliers in notable cases. Variance in relationship in the build environment across different mobility patterns, docked and dockless bike-share patterns, w.r.t. trip purpose, between arrival and departure patterns, based upon the day of week, etc. and the bike-share usage were elaborated. The paper concluded with a brief summary of the major findings of the authors and them encouraging the recommendations for the future research works.

[5] Examining factors associated with bike-and-ride (BnR) activities around metro stations in large-scale dockless bike-sharing systems:
Summary: The study attempted to examine the associations of BnR (bike and ride) activities with metro area w.r.t. DBS (dockless bike sharing) systems, in the city of Shanghai, China. The study signalled that BnR behaviors were affected by features like station features, land use, socio-demographics, roadway designs, transportation facilities, etc. Mainly four metrics were employed in the entire study to understand BnR behaviors from the perspective of different participators viz. local govt., DBS users, etc. The metrics were BnR trip count, shared-bike utilization rate, metro catchment area and BnR rate, for the assessment of BnR performance. The generalized additive model (GAM) was utilized to build statistical inference. Several statistical issues such as over-dispersion, skewness and spatial autocorrelation were addressed while modelling DBS usage. The spatial distribution of the 4 metrics suggested that shared bikes were oversupplied in the city center while undersupplied in the suburb. Based on other things, various other conclusions were drawn for comprehensive analysis.

[6] Increasing bike-sharing users' willingness to pay - a study of China based on perceived value theory and structural equation model:
Summary: In this research paper, the authors sought to investigate the correlation of the various factors of the perceived value upon the users willingness to pay for bike-sharing services in the first-tier and second-tier cities of China. A structural analysis was also conducted to validate the findings and visualize the significance of the different factors as variables. The paper analyzed the direct and indirect factors that affect bike-sharing users' willingness to pay. Based upon the findings, the authors concluded that, perceived usefullness and perceived ease-of-use have positive impact on perceived value; and perceived trust, perceived value, individual paying consciousness and environmental protection have positive impact on perceived value; the users' word-of-mouth and perceived entertainment have no significance; and finally perceived cost and perceived risk have negative impact on perceived value.

[7] Understanding the intention of using bike-sharing system: a case study in Xi'an, China:
Summary: This paper investigates the various factors which make the bike-sharing services to be retained by the users, and not just be opted by them in the first place. For data collection purposes, questionnaires were collected through both online and offline survey. A total of 650 questionnaires were collected, including 500 field surveys and 150 online questionnaires, resulting in 622 valid questionnaires. The authors introduced the related concepts of participation in purchasing decisions, customer engagement, and customer-perceived value, and uses a structural equation model to identify the interaction and influence mechanisms between the three variables and usage intent. It not only extends the scope of consumer behavior theory, but also provides management and marketing strategies for bike-sharing companies.
